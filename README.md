Image classification refers to the task of extracting information classes from a multiband raster image Depending on the interaction between the analyst and the computer during classification, there are two types of classification: supervised and unsupervised We will be working with supervised image classification</p>

<br>


  <h2>Details of the Project</h2>

<p>The Project is divided into three parts: <br<
1. Using classes like mobilenets for image classification <br>
2- Building our own model for image classification <br>
3. We build a web app with flask to mount the prediction model 4. We deploy the flask project on Heroku through github.</p>
<br><br>

  <h2>  Machine Learning Model </h2>
<p>
So we start off with preprocessing the model using ImageDataGenerator class and then move forward with training our model</p>
    <br><br>
  
  <h2> Flask Web App</h2>
<p>
This is the second part where we build the web application using the framework Flask We mount the model we build in the previous part on the Flask project</p>
  
  <br><br>
  
 <h2> Deploying on Heroku </h2>
<p>
 We will deploy the Flask application on Heroku using the connections to github</p>
