# Dog or Cat

[Play with the App](https://dogorcat.herokuapp.com/)

A simple Flask App that can classify an image as Dog or Cat
using a convolutional neural network model. I build this just
because i wanted to get out of the jupyter notebook and
deploy a Deep learning model and have something i can send
to friends so they can upload their images of their face and let my app
insult them.
